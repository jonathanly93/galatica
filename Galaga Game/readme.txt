### Galaga Final Project

If the Game.java does not run, try running ResetHighScore.java. 



Use the arrow keys to move left and right. Use space bar to shoot. Use the mouse to click on the buttons when neccessary.

Dodge incoming enemy bullet and units.

The player has 3 lives and plays in an indefinite game. The game will end when the player loses all 3 lives.

The game's dificulty is increased per level. The fighters will move faster per level and will shoot more frequently.

If the player scores in the top 10 highest scores, they may register their name in the high score list.

Sound and fighter animation should be included.

Main Menu, High Score, Game Over, and Main Game should all be included. 

High scores should be saved, but can only be viewed from the inside the game. Use ResetHighScore to add in new scores if needed.

All sounds should be included except for fighterCapture. I believe this is from a green fighter, which is not included in this verions.
