Galaga Final Project.

If the Game.java does not run, try running ResetHighScore.java. This will generate a high score list. I had issues with targeting the correct directory in which
the high scores are read. I believe I placed it in the right location, but if I did not, please run ResetHighScore.java to generate a new text file.

Use the arrow keys to move left and right. Use space bar to shoot. Use the mouse to click on the buttons when neccessary.

Dodge incoming enemy bullet and units.

The player has 3 lives and plays in an indefinite game. The game will end when the player loses all 3 lives.

The game's dificulty is increased per level. The fighters will move faster per level and will shoot more frequently.

If the player scores in the top 10 highest scores, they may register their name in the high score list.

Sound and fighter animation should be included.

Main Menu, High Score, Game Over, and Main Game should all be included. 

High scores should be saved, but can only be viewed from the inside the game. Use ResetHighScore to add in new scores if needed.

Ocassionally there may be some FPS drop and the sounds will be out of sync for a bit.

All sounds should be included except for fighterCapture. I believe this is from a green fighter, which is not included in this verions.
